I have been involved in education since the beginning of the university, several dozen every year I teach and prepare students for the central entrance exam, secondary and for advanced-level matriculation exams, as well as closed-door university exams also for exams. Although my main profile is still advanced I consider high school diploma and university mathematics subjects, so I feel that over the years I have managed to develop methods that techniques and practices that the 8th grader can use central entrance exam, as well as the secondary school leaving certificate trickier tasks can also be solved, or two such schedule/topics along which I can prepare for both exams to prepare, you are basically not fond of mathematics, or less so even students who don't feel like they belong at all.",
    "myself_description_two": "The demand for my classes made me think, to try to make these available to an even wider range of students without compromising efficiency. So in the fall intensive, small, for the last two exams from the starting academic year I also start preparatory courses for groups (6-8 people).

    "description": "I graduated from Petőfi Sándor High School in 2021. I developed an interest in languages ​​and mathematics during my high school years, which is why I decided to continue my studies in the field of economics. I continued my studies at the Bachelor of Applied Economics at Corvinus University in Budapest, which I will finish this summer. During my university years, I was a member of the Special Financial Mathematics Student Organization, and every year I studied several subjects related to this field within its framework. I also wrote a TDK thesis together with one of my group mates, in the statistics and econometrics section, the jury nominated our work for the national round. In addition, I worked as a demonstrator (teaching assistant) in econometrics for two semesters. I have been teaching mathematics since the beginning of university, and in the summer I undertake decoration work, mainly at events. I spend my free time mainly playing sports or in the company of my family and friends. I played basketball competitively until graduation, now I prefer running and swimming. In the summer, I often go to the family holiday home, we have a small weekend house in the Danube Bend; for me, tidying up the garden, grilling with friends, and playing ping-pong mean the real recharge and relaxation."
